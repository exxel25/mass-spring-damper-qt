# Mass–Spring–Damper Simulation (Qt)

## Description
This project simulates a mass–spring–damper system using C++ and the Qt framework.
It demonstrates overdamped and underdamped system behavior through numerical
calculation and real-time graphical visualization.

## Features
- Real-time animation of mass–spring system
- Overdamped and underdamped simulation modes
- Simple graphical user interface using Qt

## How to Run
1. Open the `.pro` file using Qt Creator
2. Build the project
3. Run the simulation

## Purpose
This project was developed as a programming assignment for an introductory
engineering and physics course.
