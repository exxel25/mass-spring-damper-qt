# mass-spring-damper-qt
This project simulates a mass–spring–damper system using C++ and Qt.  It demonstrates overdamped and underdamped system behavior through numerical  calculation and real-time graphical visualization. The project is intended  as an educational tool for learning basic mechanical system dynamics.
